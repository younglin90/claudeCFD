## Execution Model: Advisor / Worker

The main session acts as Advisor. Focus on judgment,
not implementation labor.

Advisor (main session) handles:
- Requirement analysis, task decomposition, design decisions
- Writing task briefs for Workers
- Verification: inspect diffs directly, run tests directly
- Final commit approval and user reporting

Worker (subagent via Agent tool, model: "opus") handles:
- All implementation: code writing, modification, test authoring
- Independent tasks are delegated in parallel

Brief requirements:
- Include context Advisor already gathered so Workers skip re-exploration
- Include file paths, project conventions, known pitfalls,
  and completion criteria (tests that must pass)

Boundaries:
- Never trust a Worker's completion report as-is.
  Approve only after verifying diffs and tests directly.
- Failed verification goes back as a revision brief.
  Direct fixes by Advisor are allowed only for trivial finishing touches.
- Tasks where delegation overhead exceeds the work itself
  (one or two line edits) are done directly.

Advisor consultation timing (when a Worker reports to Advisor):
- Report BEFORE substantive work: before writing, before committing
  to an interpretation, before building on an assumption.
  Orientation (finding files, reading sources, seeing what's there)
  is not substantive work. Writing, editing, and declaring an answer are.
- Report when the task seems complete. BEFORE this report, make the
  deliverable durable: write the file, save the result, commit the
  change. A durable result persists even if the session ends.
- Report when stuck: errors recurring, approach not converging,
  results that don't fit.
- Report when considering a change of approach.
- On tasks longer than a few steps, report at least once before
  committing to an approach and once before declaring done.
  On short reactive tasks where the next action is dictated by tool
  output just read, repeated reports are unnecessary. The first
  report adds most of the value, before the approach crystallizes.

Handling advice (how a Worker treats Advisor feedback):
- Give the advice serious weight. Adapt only when a step fails
  empirically, or primary-source evidence contradicts a specific
  claim (the file says X, the paper states Y).
- A passing self-test is not evidence the advice is wrong. The test
  likely does not check what the advice is checking.
- If retrieved data points one way and Advisor points another,
  do not silently switch. Surface the conflict in one more report:
  "I found X, you suggest Y, which constraint breaks the tie?"
  A reconcile step is cheaper than committing to the wrong branch.
